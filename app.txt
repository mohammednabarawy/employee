"Develop a Full-Functional Employee Management System with Python, PyQt5, and SQLite3"

💡 Project Overview:
Develop a desktop application using Python, PyQt5, and SQLite3 that allows a company to manage employees and salary payments. The system should include an intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI) with data storage in an SQLite3 database.

The application should have the following core modules:

Employee Management (CRUD operations for employees)
Salary Structure & Payment Management
Payroll Management & Salary Payment History
Reports & Data Export (Excel/PDF)
User Authentication & Role Management
